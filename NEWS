tellcore-py 0.8.0
==================
Release date: 2013-08-11

* Improved callback handling to simplify integration with different event
  loops. Parameter conversion is now done in the library code and the
  adaptation to different event loops is done by a simple callback dispatch
  class. The default dispatcher (when using TelldusCore) is still done using a
  queue.

* New documentation for parts of the package. Can be read online at
  https://tellcore-py.readthedocs.org/.

* Fix problem with strings and python 3 (issue #2).
