tellcore-py <next>
==================
Release date: TBD

* Improved callback handling to simplify integration with different event
  loops. Parameter conversion is now done in the library code and the
  adaptation to different event loops is done by a simple callback dispatch
  class. The default dispatcher (when using TelldusCore) is still done using a
  queue.
