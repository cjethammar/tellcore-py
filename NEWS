tellcore-py 0.9.0
------------------
Release date: 2014-01-03

* Telldus functions that used to return bool (tdSetName, tdSetProtocol,
  tdSetModel, tdSetDeviceParameter and tdRemoveDevice) now raise an exception
  instead of returning False.

* Support for rain- and windsensors.

* Include data type in :class:`telldus.SensorValue`.


tellcore-py 0.8.0
------------------
Release date: 2013-08-11

* Improved callback handling to simplify integration with different event
  loops. Parameter conversion is now done in the library code and the
  adaptation to different event loops is done by a simple callback dispatch
  class. The default dispatcher (when using :class:`telldus.TelldusCore`) is
  still done using a queue.

* New documentation for parts of the package. Can be read online at
  https://tellcore-py.readthedocs.org/.

* Fix problem with strings and python 3 (issue #2).


tellcore-py 0.1.0
-----------------
Release date: 2013-06-26
