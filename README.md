Python wrapper for Telldus Core
===============================

A [ctypes](http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html) wrapper around [Telldus
Core lib](http://developer.telldus.com/) with some extra classes to make it
more python-ish and easier to work with.

Currently a work-in-progress.


TODO
----

* Extended the unit test for TelldusCore and friends.
* Add better support for callbacks, including thread sync.
* Test it with a real TellStick.
* Improve documentation.
* Make it a proper python package.
